Welcome to Commander, a battleship approach to personal goals gamification.

This is a web based program coded in Javascript, HTML and CSS. The concept is of a battleship out at sea. It has got internal tasks for maintaining itself (maintaining engines, buying fuel, etc.) which are similar to daily chores we have as humans (Cleaning house, shopping, etc.). The battleship also has missions, which involve external tasks (reconnaissance, capturing islands...). These missions are similar to our missions in the modern world (get employed, complete studies...). 

Based on this, Commander lets you be the captain of your life while keeping track of your internal and external tasks. Internal tasks are arranged in "Buckets" while external tasks are lined over arrows that lead to an island to be "conquered". Once you have complete all external tasks, you successfully conquer that island (ex. employment 'island').
